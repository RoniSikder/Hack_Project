    <h1>Causes of Land Pollution:</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="item">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h2>AGRICULTURE</h2>
            
            <p>Agricultural activities are one of the major sources of land pollution. The spreading of plant protection products such as pesticides and herbicides, as well as the emissions of livestock buildings and farms are at the origin of soil pollution, in particular by nitrogen and phosphates.</p></li>
          <li>
            <h2>DEFORESTATION</h2>
            
            <p>Because of deforestation and forest fires, soils lose their vegetation cover. The erosion process is thus accelerated, creating soil degradation as well as water pollution. Deforestation leads to the loss of the landâ€™s value as, once converted into a dry or barren land, it can never be made fertile again.</p></li>
          <li>
            <h2>URBANIZATION</h2>
            
            <p>Urbanization is another source of land degradation. The artificialisation of soils can cause a rapid and consequent carbon depletion, which contributes to climate change. Besides, it fragments natural habitats, ecosystems and landscapes, affecting biodiversity.</p></li>
          <li>
            <h2>MINING</h2>
            
            <p>Mining waste is usually left behind in the form of spoil tips. These pit heaps can contain a wide variety of toxic substances that then seep into the ground as a result of rain. This can have a big impact on the regeneration of the vegetation.</p></li>
          <li>
            <h2>INDUSTRIAL WASTE</h2>
            
            <p>Heavy industry often produces quantities of undesirable chemicals. If cleaning agents such as detergents are released irresponsibly, they can cause significant pollution on the ground. Storage tanks can also be a major source of land pollution in case of leakage.</p></li>
          <li>
            <h2>WASTE DISPOSAL</h2>
            <p>We produce large quantities of household waste every year, many of which could and should be recycled or degrade naturally. Much of our waste is either incinerated - causing potential air pollution issues - or buried in landfills, causing soil pollution problems.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h1>How can Land Pollution be Prevented?</h1>
        <div class="container">
          <div class="item">
            <ul>
              <li><h2>Cleanup</h2>

                <p>Environmental remediation consists of removing pollution from the soil, groundwater or surface water. Bioremediation (microbes) and phytoremediation (plants) can be used to convert the pollutants into harmless products. These are natural solutions that need to be supported by in-depth actions.</p></li>
              <li><h2>Green agriculture</h2>

                <p>Sustainable agriculture is essential as it is meant to control the impact on the cultivated environment, by minimizing the external contributions (phytosanitary products), by diversifying the cultures and by using biological treatments.</p></li>
              <li><h2>Sustainable forest management</h2>

                <p>Conservation of the forests is key. Without the protection of the trees, the land becomes dry and starts to erode. Therefore, sustainable forestry or logging is crucial to saving the soil from pollution.</p></li>
              <li> <h2>Proper waste disposal</h2>

                <p>Be it for industrial or household waste, efficient waste disposal is one of the most effective ways of curbing land pollution. This especially applies to toxic and hazardous waste disposal.</p></li>
              <li><h2>The "3 R's" Rule & Education</h2>

                <p>Reducing the use of non-biodegradable products will lower plastic pollution and eventually have an impact on land pollution. This is why it is very important to reuse and recycle every possible item. Education should also play a major role in efforts to protect the environment from land pollution.</p></li>
