    <h1>Causes of Air Pollution:</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="item">
        <p>Air pollution is caused by the presence in the atmosphere of toxic substances, mainly produced by human activities, even though sometimes it can result from natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions, dust storms and wildfires, also depleting the air quality.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Combustion of fossil fuels, like coal and oil for electricity and road transport, producing air pollutants like nitrogen and sulfur dioxide.</p></li>
          <li><p>Emissions from industries and factories, releasing large amount of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, chemicals and organic compounds into the air</p></li>
          <li><p>Agricultural activities, due to the use of pesticides, insecticides, and fertilizers that emit harmful chemicals</p></li>
          <li><p>Waste production, mostly because of methane generation in landfills</p></li>
        </ul>

    <h1>How can Air Pollution be Prevented?</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="item">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h2>Renewable fuel and clean energy production :</h2>
            <p>The most basic solution for air pollution is to move away from fossil fuels, replacing them with alternative energies like solar, wind and geothermal.</p></li>
          <li>
            <h2>Energy conservation and efficiency :</h2>
            <p>Producing clean energy is crucial. But equally important is to reduce our consumption of energy by adopting responsible habits and using more efficient devices.</p></li>
          <li>
            <h2>Eco-friendly transportation :</h2> 
            <p>Shifting to electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles, and promoting shared mobility (i.e carpooling, and public transports) could reduce air pollution.</p></li>
          <li>
            <h2>Green building :</h2> 
            <p>From planning to demolition, green building aims to create environmentally responsible and resource-efficient structures to reduce their carbon footprint.</p></li>
        </ul>
